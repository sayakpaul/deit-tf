# DeiT-TF (Data-efficient Image Transformers)

This repository provides TensorFlow / Keras implementations of different DeiT
[1] variants from Touvron et al. It also provides the TensorFlow / Keras models that have been
populated with the original DeiT pre-trained params available from [2]. These
models are not blackbox SavedModels i.e., they can be fully expanded into `tf.keras.Model`
objects and one can call all the utility functions on them (example: `.summary()`).

As of today, all the TensorFlow / Keras variants of the **DeiT** models listed
[here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit#model-zoo) are available in this
repository.

Refer to the ["Using the models"](https://github.com/sayakpaul/deit-tf#using-the-models)
section to get started.

## Conversion

TensorFlow / Keras implementations are available in `vit/vit_models.py` and `vit/deit_models.py`.
Conversion utilities are in `convert.py`.

## Models

Find the models on TF-Hub here: https://tfhub.dev/sayakpaul/collections/deit/1. You can fully inspect the
model architecture like so:

```py
import tensorflow as tf

model_gcs_path = "gs://tfhub-modules/sayakpaul/deit_tiny_patch16_224/1/uncompressed"
model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_gcs_path)

dummy_inputs = tf.ones((2, 224, 224, 3))
_ = model(dummy_inputs)
print(model.summary(expand_nested=True))
```

## Results

Results are on ImageNet-1k validation set (top-1 accuracy).

Results can be verified with the code in `i1k_eval`. Original results were sourced from [2].


## Using the models

**Pre-trained models**:

* Off-the-shelf classification: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/deit-tf/blob/main/notebooks/classification.ipynb)
* Fine-tuning: [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/deit-tf/blob/main/notebooks/finetune.ipynb)

These models also output attention weights from each of the Transformer blocks.
Refer to [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sayakpaul/deit-tf/blob/main/notebooks/classification.ipynb)
for more details. Additionally, the notebook shows how to visualize the attention maps for a given image.

**Randomly initialized models**:
 
```py
from vit.model_configs import base_config
from vit.deit_models import ViTDistilled
 
 distilled_tiny_tf_config = base_config.get_config(
    name="deit_tiny_distilled_patch16_224"
)
deit_tiny_distilled_patch16_224 = ViTDistilled(distilled_tiny_tf_config)

dummy_inputs = tf.ones((2, 224, 224, 3))
_ = deit_tiny_distilled_patch16_224(dummy_inputs)
print(deit_tiny_distilled_patch16_224.summary(expand_nested=True))
```

To view different model configurations, refer to `convert_all_models.py`.


## Training with DeiT

You can refer to the `notebooks/deit-trainer.ipynb` notebok to get a sense of how distillation
is actually performed using DeiT. Additionally, that notebook also provides code in case you
wanted to train a model from scratch instead of distillation.
